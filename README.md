Not everything will work on Linux or MacOS.

### Install

```bash
# whatever you want to copy
stow nvim tmux zsh

# or everything
stow .
```

### Notes to my future self


When you inevitably forget how you set this up:

1. Yes, you need stow installed
2. Yes, you'll still spend hours tweaking this shit instead of doing real work
3. No, you won't remember why you configured things this way

If something breaks, it's your own damn fault. Good luck figuring out what you were thinking and finding all videos and reddit posts you copied the code from.
